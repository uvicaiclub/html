		<h2>April 11, 2020:</h2>
		<p>
			The UVic AI Club is coming to the end of it's second consecutive semester of operation. Projects, resources and club membership have been growing slowly. It seems that the most important time of year for the club is at the beginning of the semester, especially the fall. This is when the UVSS holds an event called club days. Clubs are encouraged to set up tables to promote their club and attract new members. As club president, the task of attracting club members falls squarely on me. Part of me simply wants to ignore it and focus on working, however that would defeat the purpose of why I started the club. It's time to start branching out into different forms of marketing: Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and YouTube. We also need an aggressive marketing campaign on campus to get everyone aware that the club exists.<br>
			<br>
			The campaign will start with a slew of flyers posted around campus advertising an event, the club will be hosting a hackathon. The project will be a collaborative process where different groups will work to complete different modules which will be brought together to complete the objective on time. I'll start working on what the project will be since I probably won't get to work on it myself, just the organization of it. I'd like the project to be simple, practical, and intriguing. Also, it needs to be something that can be accomplished in about four hours by four people.<br>
			<br>
			That's about it for now. Corona virus has made physical meetings impossible and getting anyone organized right now while they are panicking is more trouble than it is worth. I've made substantial progress on the BattleSnake project, and the Neurotech collaboration has been moving along nicely. The only project which is having trouble is the chat-bot. I'm unable to correctly establish a proper database to store data. I'll try to get this done before the summer semester starts in a few weeks.
